## Abstract
Water resources shape, and are shaped by, broader interactions with climate, land, energy, and socioeconomic systems. Reservoirs, in particular, play a significant role in modifying the spatiotemporal availability of surface water to meet multi-sector human demands, despite representing a relatively small fraction of the global water budget. Yet the integrated modelling frameworks that explore the interactions among these systems at a global scale often contain limited representations of water storage dynamics (e.g., human impacts on evolving reservoirs).  In this study, we implement a representation of global water storage in the Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM) to enable exploration of the future role (e.g., expansion) of reservoir water storage globally in meeting demands for, and evolving in response to interactions with, the climate, land, and energy systems. GCAM represents 235 global water basins, operates at 5-year time steps, and uses supply curves to capture economic competition among renewable water (e.g., via reservoirs), non-renewable groundwater, and desalination. Our approach consists of developing a Global Reservoir Yield (GLORY) model with a Linear Programming (LP) algorithm that is dynamically linked with GCAM. The new approach improves the representation of reservoir water storage in GCAM in several ways. Firstly, the GLORY model identifies the cost to supply increasing levels of reliable water supply from reservoir storage, considering regional physical and economic dynamics, including evolving monthly reservoir hydrologic inflows and demands, and the levelized cost to construct additional reservoir storage capacity. Secondly, we analyse the potential for reservoir storage capacity expansion by applying constraints related to population, protected land, water sources, and cropland. We also examine how climate and socioeconomic impacts influence the pathways for reservoir expansion. Additionally, the pioneering GLORY - GCAM feedback loop allows evolving water demands from GCAM to inform the LP-based GLORY model, resulting in an updated supply curve at each time step, and enables GCAM to establish a more meaningful economic value of water. This study improved our understanding on the sensitivity of reliable reservoir water supply to multiple physical and economic dimensions, such as sub-annual variations in climate conditions and human water demands, especially for basins experiencing socioeconomic droughts.  This new approach enables a broad suite of previously unexplored questions focused on the future of reservoir storage expansion and its multi-sector, multi-system implications under evolving forces such as climate and socioeconomic change.

## Code Reference

<!--
References for each minted software release for all code involved.  

These are generated by Zenodo automatically when conducting a release when Zenodo has been linked to your GitHub repository. The Zenodo references are built by setting the author order in order of contribution to the code using the author's GitHub user name.  This citation can, and likely should, be edited without altering the DOI.

If you have modified a codebase that is outside of a formal release, and the modifications are not planned on being merged back into a version, fork the parent repository and add a `.<shortname>` to the version number of the parent and construct your own name.  For example, `v1.2.5.hydro`.
